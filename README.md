CL-Javascript
=============

CL-JavaScript is an compiler (translator) aimed to enable scripting
software written in Common Lisp with JavaScript, thus providing much
wider acceptance of Lisp systems.

CL-JavaScript is developed by Alan Pavičić and Iva Jurišić with great
help from Marijn Haverbeke who implemented the [parse-js
library](http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/parse-js/).

CL-JavaScript is licensed under MIT public license.
