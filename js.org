* DONE move program specific symbols to js-user package

** check what is the status of automatically generated operators

** cleanup exports of net.svrg.js package and try to seal it

* DONE implement try/catch

** TODO check what is the valid semantics of defun within a catch block

* TODO standard js runtime

** TODO builtin classes
it is still unclear what is the proper behavior when constructors are
invoked without new. at the moment the only way to distinct whether
function is invoked from within new expression is to check the value
of this. if this equals global object most likely constructor is
invoked as a plain function

*** TODO Object

**** TODO new Object(val) -> val

*** DONE String

**** split is not implemented ... will be added after implementation of Array

*** TODO Array

**** sill open questions regarding the semantics of constructor

**** add methods

*** TODO Number

** TODO correct operator behavior
few arithmetic operator added. most is still missing

* TODO split js.lisp into smaller logical units

* TODO better integration with common lisp

** DONE automatically promote symbols from js-user to *global* object
think about case sensitivity

** TODO macros for defining hosting environment

** TODO easier callback to lisp

* TODO redesign tests in the same way as namos have

** TODO think of common system to share code between systems

* TODO speed up the compilation phase

* when ready, run real benchmarks from language shootout

* TODO project promotion

** TODO web site

*** think of using org-mode form web publishing

*** github/common-lisp.net (think about)

** TODO going public

*** cliki.net

** TODO documentation

** TODO presentations
